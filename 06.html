                <strong> This is the second iem's accordion body. </strong>It is hidden by default, until the collapse
                plugin adds <br> the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the
                overall <br> appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of
                this <br> custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any
                HTML <br> can go within the <span>.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow.
